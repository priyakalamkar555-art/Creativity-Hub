## About Project 💫
***Creativity Hub*** is **My First Full-Stack Web Project, built from scratch in just 20 days of learning backend development.** It’s a platform designed for creative individuals to connect, allowing users to sign up, log in, and eventually share their thoughts and images. While the current version securely stores *user information (username, email, and password) in MongoDB, future enhancements will enable image uploads, gallery views, likes, and comments.*  

***This project demonstrates not just my technical skills, but also my *consistency, discipline, and ability to learn quickly*, starting from zero backend knowledge and building a functional full-stack app in less than a month.***
